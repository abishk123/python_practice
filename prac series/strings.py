#1. Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.

#2. Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.
Sample String : google.com'
#Expected Result : {'g': 2, 'o': 3, 'l': 1, 'e': 1, '.': 1, 'c': 1, 'm': 1}

#3. Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and last 2 characters of a given string. If the string length is less than 2, return the empty string instead.

#4. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself.

#5. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string.

#6. Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing', add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.

#7. Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substrings 'not' and 'poor' in a given string. If 'not' follows 'poor', replace the whole 'not'...'poor' substring with 'good'. Return the resulting string.

#8. Write a Python function that takes a list of words and return the longest word and the length of the longest one.

#9. Write a Python program to remove the nth index character from a nonempty string.

#10. Write a Python program to change a given string to a newly string where the first and last chars have been exchanged.

#11. Write a  Python program to remove characters that have odd index values in a given string.

#12. Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given sentence.

#13. Write a Python  script that takes input from the user and displays that input back in upper and lower cases.

#14. Write a Python program that accepts a comma-separated sequence of words as input and prints the distinct words in sorted form (alphanumerically).

#15. Write a Python function to create an HTML string with tags around the word(s).
#Sample function and result :
#add_tags('i', 'Python') -> '<i>Python</i>'
#add_tags('b', 'Python Tutorial') -> '<b>Python Tutorial </b>'
